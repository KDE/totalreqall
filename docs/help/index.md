# TotalReqall Help

## Choosing a verse
Use the first two combo boxes to select a book and chapter. Now use the third combo box from the left to select the verse that you want to start at. Use the fourth combo box to select the verse to memorize through. If you only want to memorize one verse, set the third and fourth combo boxes to the same value. Click *Display verse* if you want to view the verse before memorizing it.

## Memorizing
When you are ready to memorize the verse, click *Memorize verse*. You will be presented with a screen containing the verse displayed in gray text and a button reading *Stop memorizing*. Clicking this button will halt the memorization session and return you to the verse selection page. 

To begin memorizing, type the first letter of each word. The whole verse is displayed at this point, so it should be fairly straightforward to figure out the first letter of each word. Once you have typed in the whole verse, the *Stop memorizing* button's text will change to *Continue*. Click *Continue*.

Now you will be presented with a screen similar to the last one. However, this screen only shows every other word. Proceed as before by typing the first letter of each word. If you get stuck while in Redo mode, you can type a question mark (`?`) to fill in the next word. This hint will be marked in red. When you finish, click *Continue*.

The final screen that you will be shown does not give you any hints at all. You will have to type it in completely from memory. When you finish, click *Continue* to return to the verse selection screen. From now until you close this instance of TotalReqall, you will no longer have to go through the three-step process when you choose to memorize the verse that you just memorized. Instead, you will be shown only one screen, where you will need to fill out the verse from memory.
