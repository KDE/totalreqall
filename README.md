A program for memorizing the Bible and other works. Written in C++ with Qt.

## Installing
When downloading the code, make sure you've downloaded all submodules as well. If not, run `git submodule init` in the code directory. Then open the project in Qt Creator and press Ctrl-R (or otherwise run the program).
