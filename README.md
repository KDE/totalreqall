# Windows
I have not yet perfected a solution for building on Windows. Importing the code into a Visual Studio project should work just fine, however. In the future, I want to make a build.bat file that will build on Windows. If you would like to help me with this batch file, please contact me and I will give you details of what the batch file should do.

# Other platforms
I have not ported this program to other platforms. If you get it working on your platform, please send me a pull request.
