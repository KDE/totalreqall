# TotalReqall
A program for memorizing the Bible and other works. Written in C++ with Qt. Now using the Sword library.

## Usage
Start the program and choose a book, chapter, and verse. If you want to familiarize yourself with the verse, click "Display verse". Otherwise, click "Memorize verse" to memorize it.

## Installing
When downloading the code, make sure you've downloaded all submodules as well. If not, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` in the code directory. You will also need to install the Sword library (on Ubuntu 20.04: `sudo apt install libsword-1.8.1`). Then open the project in Qt Creator and press Ctrl-R (or otherwise run the program).

## What's with the name?
This program is designed to help you memorize things, hence "Total Recall". The *q* in "TotalReqall" references the fact that this software is made using Qt.
